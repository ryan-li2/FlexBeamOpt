# FlexBeamOpt SATCOM Data

The system model used for this analysis considers the forward downlink of a single, multi-beam GEO HTS positioned over the Australasia region. The payload architecture is representative of a phased-array fed reflector (PAFR) antenna system operating in the Ka-Band utilising a digital bent- pipe transponder with digital channelizer and beamformer with each beams position and beam width being independently configurable within the scan angle of the antenna. The simultaneous beam count and electronic scan range of a PAFR is constrained by the feed array size and spacing, radio frequency manifolding, amplitude and phase control and the digital beamforming design. The system parameters as defined in Table 1 have been selected to reflect characteristics of a typical HTS while allowing for the flexibility afforded to a PAFR antenna system within realistic design constraints.

The satellite downlink operates between 19.7-20.2 GHz with a dual frequency, dual polarization scheme allowing each downlink beam to occupy 250MHz bandwidth. Adaptive modulating and coding schemes based on the DVB-S2X standard have been utilized with the load limit of each beam based on the best spectral efficiency achievable after consideration of the required link margin, output-back off and roll-off factor.

The antenna is able to produce N discrete beams with a minimum beam width of ωmin to a maximum of ωmax details the procedure used to calculate beam-Earth intersection areas accounting for the orbital position of the reference satellite. The beam radiation patterns are generated under two limiting assumptions; interactions between the antennas radiation and the Earth’s atmosphere, and small variations in an individual beam’s received power density due to distance from the transmitter are neglected. The assumptions do not extend beyond generating beam layout geometry – link budget equations consider atmospheric interactions and small variations in slant range.

Using a nominal gain radiation pattern beyond the HPBW from ITU recommendations for fixed satellite beams, an angle relating to a gain reduction of -25dB has been selected to correspond to the angular separation constraints for beams allocated to the same color. The radio frequency propagation model used within the link budget equations are derived from ITU recommendations and link budget equations contained within. The atmospheric model used for Carrier to Noise Ratio (CNR) calculations assumes clear skies, with slant ranges, elevation angles and free space path loss calculations. Table 1 outlines loss values used in the link budget calculation and represent nominal losses within a reference Ka-band SATCOM system. Demand and terminal parameters of Users is generated randomly from representative data ranges and is consistent across both models.

Problem instances to assess the performance of the across the Australian geographic region. The geographic distribution, demand distribution and total number of users define the instance controllable developed algorithms are developed through consideration of SATCOM operating scenarios input parameters. Instances considering realistic user distributions represent congested traffic areas based on population densities, sea lines of communication and commercial hubs. The 500 user realistic instance with user demand selected randomly between nominal values acts as the reference scenario, with follow-on user demands being adjusted to ensure negligible total demand variation across instances. Simulation data for a representative phased array fed reflector antenna based on realistic modern design constraints. A beam footprint simulator has been developed to capture the geographic elongation of user beams when projected onto the Earth. Table 3 details the instances used within the experimental analysis.
